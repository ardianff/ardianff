Hi, I'm Ardian. I graduated in Informatics Engineering and currently work as a full-stack website developer. In my work, I use Laravel, Codeigniter, Spring Boot, and Vue as the frontend framework. Apart from being a full-stack developer, I also work on creating microservices API using JWT for security purposes. My motivation is to learn and gain new knowledge and experiences that I can apply to myself.
